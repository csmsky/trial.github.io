            <h3>Gela <span class="love">ðŸ’œ</span> Ken</h3>
            <p>Happy Anniversary, Babb! First of all, thank you for everything, especially for being by my side since
                our day one. Every moment we've shared together is worth thanking God for. I never took you for granted,
                never will. Be able to give 100% effort in everything between us, I vow. Whenever negativity is circling
                quietly and doubts creeping up slowly, Love between us always manages to overcome and get loud. Forever
                grateful for you, an emobidment of a blessing shaded in blue.</p>

            <p>Many says that Good Karma is something that is good, elegant, loving, and amiable. I never believed in
                such things until it happened to me. I always strive for the greatness in me and proving myself wrong of
                any doubts I laid into the table myself. In the process of improving is when I met a Good, Elegant,
                Loving, and Amiableâ€”my Good Karma, you. </p>

            <p>There is a lot more for us to uncover, the reality of living and the fantasies of our heavenly dreams.
                We've built something that cannot be torn, with love and trust serving as its foundation. I thank God
                for you, sending a person to brige the gaps of my old self to something new. I thank you, for allowing
                the curiousity and vulnerability of your heart to me. It was never easy to say the least, but it was
                never something that I peeved. May we never lose the battle of our lives and may we continue to pursue
                our dreams together 'till the end of times. My treasure beyond measure.</p>
